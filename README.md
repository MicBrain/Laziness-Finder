Midterm-Data-Project
====================

   This project was created in 9 hours during a hackathon. Team members -- Rafayel Mkrtchyan, Nick Rose and Vishnu Murthy.

   The program suggests you where to live, based on how lazy you are. This python project uses data from a short quiz and from the CDC to match you with list of 5 states in the US where you might like to live. Where you are placed is based on how lazy you are, and how lazy these states are. -- October 23, 2013
