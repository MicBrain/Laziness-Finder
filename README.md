Midterm-Data-Project
====================

Where you should live, based on how lazy you are.

by Rafael Mkrtchyan, Nick Rose, and Vishnu Murthy

This python program uses data from a short quiz and from the CDC to match you with list of 5 states 
in the US where you might like to live. Where you are placed is based on how lazy you are, and how 
lazy these states are. 

We also have a Regions.py program. It reports the relative laziness of different regions of the US. 

We are students in CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. Special thanks to TA Samir Makhani for teaching us Python and 
Unix in the span of 20 minutes.
